#My Name is Uday Shankar In this project I used Machine Learning to create a Real Time American Sign Language Detector

1)TrainYourModel Run this code to capture photos of the various signs i.e. create your own dataset
Now create your model using Teaching Machine

2)TestYourModel Run this code to test your model by detecting signs in Real Time
Note: Accuracy depends on the dataset you provide
